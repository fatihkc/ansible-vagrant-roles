## Ansible Playbooks for Vagrant VMs

This project is created for personal usage. I am currently writing vairous playbooks for experimental purposes. 

This project includes;

- Kubernetes
- Wordpress

Playbooks are based on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18.04. They are not supporting both of them.

Each playbook have their own Vagrantfile. Some of the projects like Kubernetes triggered when you create VMs.
